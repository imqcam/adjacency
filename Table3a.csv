DD simulations don't differentiate SSDs from GNDs. The reconciliation approach is still in discussion,Ghosh group - DD simulations don't differentiate SSDs from GNDs. The reconciliation approach is still in discussion.,Discussion with Ghosh on alpha/beta interface modelling and crack modelling. We will need to validate our results with the current CP model on some simple cases.
